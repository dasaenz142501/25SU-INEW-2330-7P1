## Project Proposal
Toyota USA, 
We at DS INC. aim to develop a database-driven management system that bridges the gap between customers and dealership service desks, enabling direct purchasing of automotive parts. 
The solution will streamline inventory management, customer interactions, and sales processing through an intuitive application, built using C# and SQL.
Sincerely,

## Problem Statement
Traditional dealership parts purchasing requires interaction with the service desk, leading to inefficiencies such as long wait times, miscommunications, and limited accessibility for customers. The lack of a self-service option results in inconvenience and potential loss of sales.
## Proposed Solution
This project will implement a Database Management System (DBMS) that allows customers, managers, and employees to efficiently interact with inventory and transactions. The application will have multiple access levels, ensuring tailored functionalities for different users
## Features
- Allow new users to create an account for the purpose of purchasing items
- Shopping experience must include a Point of Sales for employees/managers and shopping cart for customers, receipts and invoices as output
- Provide a manager the ability to maintain customer data, inventory, promotional codes, and sales reports
## Dataflow
- Customers create accounts and browse inventory.
- Shopping cart processes user selections.
- Transactions handled through the POS system.
- Data stored in SQL Server, accessible via structured queries.
- Managers can update inventory, analyze sales reports, and manage promotions.
## Technologies Used
- Front-End: C#
- Back-End: SQL
